## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

## ToDo

[] improve API endpoint: current version developed in the beginning of nextjs13, due to lack of information and compatibility it might not be very efficient; possible next steps could be a stand alone server and integration with [formidable](https://github.com/node-formidable/formidable)
